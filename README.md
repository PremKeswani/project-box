## Introduction

Project Box is designed to help you explore various aspects of programming in C. From basic algorithms to complex networking projects, this repository covers a wide range of topics. You can find projects that challenge your problem-solving skills and enhance your understanding of C.

## Features

- **Algorithms**: Implementations of various algorithms to help you understand data structures and logic.
- **Games**: Simple command-line games that demonstrate C programming concepts in a fun way.
- **Networking**: Projects that illustrate socket programming and client-server architecture.

## Installation

To get started with the projects in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PremKeswani/project-box.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd project-box
```

You can then compile the individual projects using `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc -o my_project my_project.c
```

## Usage

After compiling the projects, you can run them from the command line. For example:

```bash
./my_project
```

Make sure to check the documentation provided in each project folder for specific instructions on how to run them.

## Projects Overview

### Algorithms

In the algorithms section, you will find implementations of common algorithms, such as sorting and searching. Each algorithm comes with explanations and example inputs to help you understand how they work.

### Games

The games section includes several fun CLI games. You can challenge yourself or your friends with these games while learning more about game development in C. 

### Networking

The networking projects demonstrate how to create client-server applications using socket programming. These projects will help you understand the basics of network communication and how to handle multiple clients.
